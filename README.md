Previously, my research
mentors and I analysed the
flat (numerical) overlap of
these cellular ensembles. If
the overlap is above the
‘random chance’ threshold,
then people can generally
infer certain things about this
sort of memory storage.

But then I thought - why not
investigate the spatial distribution
of these cellular ensembles. So, I
transformed our micrographs into
3D arrays.
